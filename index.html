<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>This is my spot for me to learn about HTML and CSS. Maybe I'll get to a point where I can do more. </p>
</br>
<p>I don't have a plan for this website which will make it a bit difficult to learn with it. Right now I'm just hoping that I'll come up with a use before I start digging into relearning HTML and learning CSS.</p>
